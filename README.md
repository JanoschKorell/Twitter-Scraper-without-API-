# Twitter-Scraper-without-API-


Because the previous ways to do data mining on Twitter are limited to sometimes poorly functioning libraries using the Twitter API, I wrote a piece of code over which I have my own control and for which no API is necessary. 

The following limitations exist:

1. since you are working with Selenium and therefore with the browser, this method is very slow and it is possible that something does not load or loads poorly; however, this is rare.

2. of course only what can be seen in the frontend can be read in.
